# Libft Project

42 School's first project, **Libft**, is about learning how the standard functions of C programming work by coding them from scratch and creating our very own library. The goal of this project is to implement some of the most commonly used C library functions and get familiar with how the standard C functions are designed.

This project has been archived in the state it was in at the time of evaluation.

**Libft** is an essential project since this library will be used in future 42 School assignments. If you're a 42 student, I highly recommend you go through the process of writing your own code, testing it yourself, and troubleshooting issues. Don't just copy-paste code you don't fully understand. If youâ€™ve completed your piscine, there is no reason why you couldn't solve this project yourself! Be patient, test thoroughly, and always strive for understanding.

## Status
Finished: 2024-11-10. Grade: 125/100.

## Usage
To compile the mandatory functions:

```bash
make
```

To compile with the bonus functions:

```bash
make bonus
```

## Included Functions

### Mandatory Functions
The mandatory functions of **libft** are a mix of functions from the C standard library and some useful utility functions that you'll often need in other projects. Mastery of these 34 mandatory functions is essential for a 100% grade.

#### Functions to check and manipulate characters:
- `ft_isalpha` - Checks if the character is an alphabet letter.
- `ft_isdigit` - Checks if the character is a digit.
- `ft_isalnum` - Checks if the character is alphanumeric.
- `ft_isascii` - Checks if the character is a valid ASCII character.
- `ft_isprint` - Checks if the character is printable.
- `ft_toupper` - Converts a character to uppercase.
- `ft_tolower` - Converts a character to lowercase.

#### Functions to manipulate strings:
- `ft_strlen` - Returns the length of a string.
- `ft_strlcpy` - Copies a string with size limitation.
- `ft_strlcat` - Appends a string with size limitation.
- `ft_strchr` - Finds the first occurrence of a character in a string.
- `ft_strrchr` - Finds the last occurrence of a character in a string.
- `ft_strncmp` - Compares two strings.
- `ft_strnstr` - Finds the first occurrence of a substring in a string.
- `ft_substr` - Creates a substring.
- `ft_strjoin` - Joins two strings into one.
- `ft_strtrim` - Trims unwanted characters from a string.
- `ft_split` - Splits a string into an array of substrings.
- `ft_strmapi` - Applies a function to each character of a string and creates a new string.
- `ft_striteri` - Applies a function to each character of a string, modifying it in place.

#### Functions to manipulate memory:
- `ft_calloc` - Allocates memory and initializes it to zero.
- `ft_memset` - Fills a memory area with a specified value.
- `ft_bzero` - Sets a memory area to zero.
- `ft_memcpy` - Copies memory from one area to another.
- `ft_memmove` - Moves memory from one area to another, handling overlap.
- `ft_memchr` - Searches for a byte in a memory area.
- `ft_memcmp` - Compares two memory areas.
- `ft_strdup` - Duplicates a string by allocating memory for it.

#### Functions for numbers:
- `ft_atoi` - Converts a string to an integer.
- `ft_itoa` - Converts an integer to a string.

#### Functions to write to a file descriptor:
- `ft_putchar_fd` - Writes a character to a file descriptor.
- `ft_putstr_fd` - Writes a string to a file descriptor.
- `ft_putendl_fd` - Writes a string followed by a newline to a file descriptor.
- `ft_putnbr_fd` - Writes an integer to a file descriptor.

### Bonus Functions
The bonus functions of **libft** are focused on list manipulation, which is an important skill for data structures and algorithms. Completing the bonus part adds an extra 25% to your final grade.

- `ft_lstnew` - Creates a new list element.
- `ft_lstadd_front` - Adds a new element to the front of the list.
- `ft_lstsize` - Returns the size of the list.
- `ft_lstlast` - Returns the last element of the list.
- `ft_lstadd_back` - Adds a new element to the back of the list.
- `ft_lstdelone` - Deletes a single list element.
- `ft_lstclear` - Deletes all elements in the list.
- `ft_lstiter` - Iterates through a list and applies a function to each element.
- `ft_lstmap` - Creates a new list by applying a function to each element of an existing list.
